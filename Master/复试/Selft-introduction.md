Good afternoon, dear professors, it's my great honor to have the opportunity to introduce myself here. My name is Suyifan. I come from He'ze, a beautiful and historical city of Shandong Province. **I graduated from the Department of Computer and Science Technology at Guangxi University.** I will introduce myself from three aspects: my educational background, my practical skills, my academic interests, and my future plan.

Firstly, during my college years, I worked hard and learnt a lot. With a GPA of 3.7, I rank the top 6% among peers in my grade. **I have also earned scholarship for my academic performance and got prizes in many competitions.**

For practical skills, **As a team leader**, I applied for the National College Students' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Plan, completed four software copyright applications. I highly value the open-source spirit, actively contributing code to open-source communities, primarily the Neovim community on Github.

Finally, My academic interests lie in **computer systems and software**. Inspired by the book: _Computer Systems: A Programmerâ€™s Perspective_, I developed a deep understanding of **compilation, assembly, linking, and loading**. In the future, I hope to research in these area.

- Finally, for academic Interests. From my first encounter with the field of computer science, I developed a profound interest in the operation of the entire computer system. Then, I read the "Computer Systems: A programmer's Perspective", gaining a deeper understanding of program compilation, assembly, linking, and loading. Therefore, in the future, I hope to research areas related to computer theory or computer architecture.
