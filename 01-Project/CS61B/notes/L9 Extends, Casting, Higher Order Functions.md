# Note

概念：
- **Static Type** VS **Dynamic Type**
- **Override** VS **Overload**
- **向上转型** VS **向下转型**
- 父类对象调用子类方法（多态）
- 子类对象调用父类方法（继承）

多态只发生在父类对象调用被子类重构的方法时（只能是重构，重载都不行）。也就是静态类型是父类，动态类型是子类时且子类重构了父类的方法。

# 2 Overview

## 2.1 The Interface and implements.

Up to now we have been writing classes and interfaces, and you have may noticed places where we have had to write redundant code for different (but similar!) classes. This leads us to the idea of inheritance, the idea that a class/object does not need to redefine all its methods, and instead can use properties of a parent class. Lets first note some differences between inheritence of a parent class and interfaces (Note that a class can do both, even at the same time! Here is the syntax for implemeting an interface:

```java
SLList<Blorp> implements List61B<Blorp>
```

Similarly, the way for a class to extend the qualities of another class the syntax is as follows:

```java
Class_Name extends Class_Name
```

## 2.2 Usage of Inheritance.

Say we wanted to make a special type of `SLList` called `RotatingSLList`. `RotatingSLList` should be able to do everyhthing that SLList can; however, it should also be able to rotate to the right. How can we do this? Well this is just an application of Inheritance! Doing the following will allow for RotatingSLList to have all the qualities of SLList as well as its own method `rotateRight`.

```java
public class RotatingSLList<Blorp> extends SLList<Blorp>{
  public void rotateRight() {...}
}
```

## 2.3 What is Inherited?

We have a powerful tool in Inheritance now; however, we will define a few rules. For now, we will say that we can inherit:

-   instance and static variables
-   all methods
-   all nested classes This changes a little bit with the introduction of private variables but don’t worry about that right now. The one item that is not inherited is a class’s constructor.

## 2.4 The Special Case of the Constructor?

Even though constructor’s are not inherited, we still use them. We can call the constructor explicitly by using the keyword `super()`. At the start of every constructor, there is already an implicit call to its super class`s constructor. As a result

```java
public VengefulSLList() {
  deletedItems = new SLList<Item>();
}
```

is equivalent to

```java
public VengefulSLList() {
  super();
  deletedItems = new SLList<Item>();
}
```

However, constructor`s with arguments are not implicitly called. This means that.

```java
public VengefulSLList() {
    super(x);
    deletedItems = new SLList<Item>();
  }
```

is not equivalent to

```java
public VengefulSLList() {
    deletedItems = new SLList<Item>();
  }
```

This is because only the empty argument `super()` is called.

## 2.5 Is A. 

When a class inherits from another, we know that it must have all the qualities of it. This means that `VengefulSLList` is a `SLList` because it has all the qualities of an `SLList`- it just has a few additional ones too.

Every single class is a descendent on the Object class, meaning they are all Objects.

## 2.6 Abstraction (⭐️) 

As you’ll learn later in this class, programs can get a tad confusing when they are really large. A way to make programs easier to handle is to use abstraction. Basically abstraction is hiding components of programs that people do not need to see. The user of the hidden methods should be able to use them without knowing how they work.

An intuitive way to realize the motivation of abstraction is to look at yourself. You are a human (unless some robot is looking at this in which case I am sorry for offending you) and humans can eat food and convert it to energy. You do not need to know how you convert food to energy you just know that it works. **In this case think of your conversion of food to energy as a method and the input is food and the output is energy.**

## 2.7 Casting

In Java, every object has a **static type** (defined at compile-time) and a **dynamic type** (defined at run-time). Our code may rely on the fact that some variable may be a more specific type than the static type. For example if we had the below definitions:

```java
Poodle frank  = new Poodle("Frank", 5);
Poodle frankJr = new Poodle("Frank Jr.", 15);
```

This statement would be valid

```java
Dog largerDog = maxDog(frank, frankJr);
```

But this one would not be

```java
Poodle largerPoodle = maxDog(frank, frankJr);
```

The reason the former statement is valid is because the compilers knows for a fact that anything that is returned from a `maxDog` function call is a `Dog`. However, in the latter case, the compiler does not know for a fact that the return value of `maxDog` would result in a `Poodle` even though both `Dog` arguments are `Poodle`s.

Instead of being happy with just having a generic `Dog`, we can be a bit risky and use a technique called casting. Casting allows us to force the static type of a variable, basically tricking the compiler into letting us force the static type of am expression. To make `largerPoodle` into a static type `Poodle` we will use the following:

```java
Poodle largerPoodle = (Poodle) maxDog(frank, frankJr);
```

Note that we are not changing the actual dynamic type of maxDog- we are just telling the compiler what is coming out of maxDog will be a `Poodle`. This means that any reference to `largerPoodle` will have a static type of `Poodle` associated with it.

**Casting, while powerful is also quite dangerous**. You need to ensure that what you are casting to can and will actually happen. There are a few rules that can be used:

-   You can always cast up (to a more generic version of a class) without fear of ruining anything because we know the more specific version is a version of the generic class. For example you can always cast a Poodle to a Dog because all Poodles are Dog’s.
    
-   You can also cast down (to a more specific version of a class) with **caution** as you need to **make sure** that, during runtime, nothing is passed in that violates your cast. For example, sometimes Dog’s are Poodle’s but not always.
    
-   Finally, you cannot ever cast to a class that is neither above or below the class being cast. For an example, you cannot cast a Dog to a Monkey because a Monkey is not in the direct lineage of a Dog - it is a child of Animal so a bit more distant. You can think of this as “side casting” and it will result in a compile time error since the compiler knows this cast cannot possibly work.
